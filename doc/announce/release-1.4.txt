tox 1.4: the virtualenv-based test run automatizer
===========================================================================

I am happy to announce tox 1.4 brings:

- improvements with configuration file syntax, now allowing re-using
  selected settings across config file sections. see 

- terminal reporting was simplified and streamlined.  Now on
  verbosity==0 (the default), less information will be shown
  and you can use one or multiple "-v" options to increase verbosity.

- internal re-organisation so that the separately released "detox" 
  tool can reuse tox code to implement a fully distributed tox run.

Installation:

    pip install -U tox

What is tox?
----------------

tox standardizes and automates tedious test activities driven from a
simple ``tox.ini`` file, including:

* creation and management of different virtualenv environments 
  with different Python interpreters
* packaging and installing your package into each of them
* running your test tool of choice, be it nose, py.test or unittest2 or other tools such as "sphinx" doc checks
* testing dev packages against each other without needing to upload to PyPI

best,
Holger Krekel
