tox configuration specification
================================

.. _ConfigParser: http://docs.python.org/library/configparser.html

``tox.ini`` files uses the standard ConfigParser_ "ini-style" format.
Below you find the specification, but you might want to skim some
:doc:`examples` first and use this page as a reference.

Tox global settings
----------------------

List of optional global options::

    [tox]
    minversion=ver    # minimally required tox version
    toxworkdir=path   # tox working directory, defaults to {toxinidir}/.tox
    setupdir=path     # defaults to {toxinidir}
    distdir=path      # defaults to {toxworkdir}/dist
    distshare=path    # defaults to {homedir}/.tox/distshare
    envlist=ENVLIST   # defaults to the list of all environments


``tox`` autodetects if it is running in a Jenkins_ context
(by checking for existence of the ``JENKINS_URL`` environment variable)
and will first lookup global tox settings in this section::

    [tox:hudson]
    ...               # override [tox] settings for the hudson context
    # note: for hudson distshare defaults to ``{toxworkdir}/distshare``.


envlist setting
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Determining the environment list that ``tox`` is to operate one
happens in this order:

* command line option ``-eENVLIST``
* environment variable ``TOXENV``
* ``tox.ini`` file's ``envlist``


Virtualenv test environment settings
-------------------------------------------

Test environments are defined by a::

    [testenv:NAME]
    ...

section.  The ``NAME`` will be the name of the virtual environment.
Defaults for each setting in this section are looked up in the::

    [testenv]
    ...

testenvironment default section.

Complete list of settings that you can put into ``testenv*`` sections:

.. confval:: basepython=NAME-OR-PATH

    name or path to a Python interpreter which will be used for creating
    the virtual environment. **default**: interpreter used for tox invocation.

.. confval:: commands=ARGVLIST

    the commands to be called for testing. Each command is defined
    by one or more lines; a command can have multiple lines if a line
    ends with the ``\`` character in which case the subsequent line
    will be appended (and may contain another ``\`` character ...).
    For eventually performing a call to ``subprocess.Popen(args, ...)``
    ``args`` are determined by splitting the whole command by whitespace.

.. confval:: changedir=path

    change to this working directory when executing the test command.
    **default**: ``{toxinidir}``

.. confval:: deps=MULTI-LINE-LIST

    test-specific dependencies -.to be installed into the environment prior to project
    package installation.  Each line defines a dependency, which will be
    passed to easy_install/pip for processing.  A line specify a file,
    an URL or a package name.  You can additionally specify
    an :confval:`indexserver` to use for installing this dependency.
    All derived dependencies (deps required by the dep) will then be
    retrieved from the specified indexserver::

        deps = :myindexserver:pkg

.. confval:: setenv=MULTI-LINE-LIST
   
   .. versionadded:: 0.9

   each line contains a NAME=VALUE environment variable setting which
   will be used for all test command invocations as well as for installing
   the sdist package into a virtual environment.

.. confval:: recreate=True|False(default)

    Always recreate virtual environment if this option is True.

.. confval:: downloadcache=path

    (pip only) use this directory for caching downloads - this defaults to the
    environment variable ``PIP_DOWNLOAD_CACHE`` if it is set.
    **default**: no download cache will be used.
    **note**: if creating multiple environments use of a download cache greatly
    speeds up the testing process.

.. confval:: distribute=True|False

    Set to ``False`` if you want to use setuptools_ instead of the default
    distribute_ in the virtual environment.
    **default:** True.

.. confval:: sitepackages=True|False

    Set to ``True`` if you want to create virtual environments that also
    have access to globally installed packages.  **default:** False, meaning
    that virtualenvs will be created with ``--no-site-packages`` by default.

.. confval:: args_are_paths=BOOL

    treat positional arguments passed to ``tox`` as file system paths
    and - if they exist on the filesystem - rewrite them according
    to the ``changedir``.
    **default**: True (due to the exists-on-filesystem check it's usually
    safe to try rewriting).

.. confval:: envtmpdir=path

    defines a temporary directory for the virtualenv which will be cleared
    each time before the group of test commands is invoked.
    **default**: ``{envdir}/tmp``

.. confval:: envlogdir=path

    defines a directory for logging where tox will put logs of tool
    invocation.
    **default**: ``{envdir}/log``

.. confval:: indexserver

   .. versionadded:: 0.9

   Multi-line ``name = URL`` definitions of python package servers.
   Depedencies can specify using a specified index server through the
   ``:indexservername:depname`` pattern.  The ``default`` indexserver
   definition determines where unscoped dependencies and the sdist install
   installs from.  Example::

        [tox]
        indexserver =
            default = http://mypypi.org

   will make tox install all dependencies from this PYPI index server
   (including when installing the project sdist package).


Substitutions
---------------------

Any ``key=value`` setting in an ini-file can make use
of value substitution through the ``{...}`` string-substitution pattern.

Globally available substitutions
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

``{toxinidir}``
    the directory where tox.ini is located

``{toxworkdir}``
    the directory where virtual environments are created and sub directories
    for packaging reside.

``{homedir}``
    the user-home directory path.

``{distdir}``
    the directory where sdist-packages will be created in

``{distshare}``
    the directory where sdist-packages will be copied to so that
    they may be accessed by other processes or tox runs.

substitutions for virtualenv-related sections
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

``{envname}``
    the name of the virtual environment
``{envpython}``
    path to the virtual Python interpreter
``{envdir}``
    directory of the virtualenv hierarchy
``{envbindir}``
    directory where executables are located
``{envtmpdir}``
    the environment temporary directory
``{envlogdir}``
    the environment log directory


environment variable substitutions
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If you specify a substitution string like this::

    {env:KEY}

then the value will be retrieved as ``os.environ['KEY']``
and raise an Error if the environment variable
does not exist.

.. _`command positional substitution`:
.. _`positional substitution`:

substitutions for positional arguments in commands
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. versionadded:: 1.0

If you specify a substitution string like this::

    {posargs:DEFAULTS}

then the value will be replaced with positional arguments as provided
to the tox command::

    tox arg1 arg2

In this instance, the positional argument portion will be replaced with
``arg1 arg2``. If no positional arguments were specified, the value of
DEFAULTS will be used instead. If DEFAULTS contains other substitution
strings, such as ``{env:*}``, they will be interpreted.,

Use a double ``--`` if you also want to pass options to an underlying
test command, for example::

    tox -- --opt1 ARG1

will make the ``--opt1 ARG1`` appear in all test commands where ``[]`` or
``{posargs}`` was specified.  By default (see ``args_are_paths``
setting), ``tox`` rewrites each positional argument if it is a relative
path and exists on the filesystem to become a path relative to the
``changedir`` setting.

Previous versions of tox supported the ``[.*]`` pattern to denote
positional arguments with defaults. This format has been deprecated.
Use ``{posargs:DEFAULTS}`` to specify those.


Substition with values from other sections
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. versionadded:: 1.4

Values from other sections can be refered to via::

   {[sectionname]valuename}

which you can use to avoid repetition of config values.
You can put default values in one section and reference them in others to avoid repeting the same values::

    [base]
    deps =
        pytest
        mock
        pytest-xdist
    
    [testenv:dulwich]
    deps =
        dulwich
        {[tools]deps}

    [testenv:mercurial]
    dep =
        mercurial
        {[tools]deps}



Other Rules and notes
=========================

* ``path`` specifications: if a specified ``path`` is a relative path
  it will be considered as relative to the ``toxinidir``, the directory
  where the configuration file resides.
