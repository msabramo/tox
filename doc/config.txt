tox configuration
================================

.. _ConfigParser: http://docs.python.org/library/configparser.html

``tox.ini`` files uses the standard ConfigParser_ "ini-style" format. 
Below you find the specification, you might want to skim some 
:doc:`examples` first. 

Global settings
----------------------

List of optional global options::

    [global]
    toxworkdir=path  # tox working directory, defaults to {toxinidir}/.tox
    setupdir=path    # defaults to {toxinidir} 
    logdir=path      # defaults to {toxworkdir}/log

Test environment settings 
------------------------------

Test environments are defined by a::

    [testenv:NAME]
    ...

section.  The ``NAME`` will be the name of the virtual environment. 
Defaults for each setting in this section are looked up in the::

    [testenv]
    ...

testenvironment default section. 

Complete list of settings that you can put into ``testenv*`` sections:

``basepython=NAME-OR-PATH``
    name or path to a Python interpreter which will be used for creating
    the virtual environment. **default**: interpreter used for tox invocation. 

``argv=MULTI-LINE``
    the test command to be called for testing. Each line defines one 
    item of a list that will be passed to ``subprocess.Popen``. 

``changedir=path``
    change to this working directory when executing the test command. 
    **default**: ``{toxinidir}``

``envtmpdir=path``
    defines a temporary directory for the virtualenv which will be cleared
    before invoking the test command.  
    **default**: ``{envdir}/tmp``

``deps=MULTI-LINE-LIST``
    dependencies to be installed into the environment prior to project
    package installation.  Each line defines a dependency, which will be
    passed to easy_install/pip for processing. 

``downloadcache=path``
    (pip only) use this directory for caching downloads - this defaults to the 
    environment variable ``PIP_DOWNLOAD_CACHE`` if it is set. 
    **default**: no download cache will be used. 
    **note**: if creating multiple environments use of a download cache greatly 
    speeds up the testing process. 

``distribute=BOOL``
    Set to ``True`` if you want to use distribute in the virtual environment. 
    **default:** False. (setuptools will be used)

Substitutions
---------------------

Any ``key=value`` setting in an ini-file can make use
of value substitution through the ``{...}`` string-substitution pattern. 

Globally available substitutions
