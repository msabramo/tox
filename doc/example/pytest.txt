py.test and tox
=================================

It is easy to integrate `py.test`_ runs with tox.  If you encounter
issues, please check if they are `listed as a known issue`_ and/or use
the :doc:`support channels <../support>`.

Basic example
--------------------------

Assuming the following layout::

    tox.ini      # see below for content
    setup.py     # a classic distutils/setuptools setup.py file

and the following ``tox.ini`` content::

    [tox]
    envlist = py26,py31

    [testenv]
    deps=pytest       # PYPI package providing py.test
    commands=
      py.test \
            []        # substitute with tox' positional arguments

you can now invoke ``tox`` in the directory where your ``tox.ini`` resides.
``tox`` will sdist-package your project, create two virtualenv environments
with the ``python2.6`` and ``python3.1`` interpreters, respectively, and will
then run the specified test command in each of them.

Extended example: change dir before test and use per-virtualenv tempdir
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Assuming the following layout::

    tox.ini      # see below for content
    setup.py     # a classic distutils/setuptools setup.py file
    tests        # the directory containing tests

and the following ``tox.ini`` content::

    [tox]
    envlist = py26,py31
    [testenv]
    changedir=tests
    deps=pytest
    commands=
      py.test \
        --basetemp={envtmpdir}  \ # py.test tempdir setting
        []                        # substitute with tox' positional arguments

you can invoke ``tox`` in the directory where your ``tox.ini`` resides.
Differently than in the previous example the ``py.test`` command
will be executed with a current working directory set to ``tests``
and the test run will use the per-virtualenv temporary directory.

.. _`passing positional arguments`:

Using multiple CPUs for test runs
-----------------------------------

``py.test`` supports distributing tests to multiple processes and hosts
through the `pytest-xdist`_ plugin.  Here is an example configuration
to make ``tox`` use this feature::

    [testenv]
    deps=pytest-xdist
    changedir=tests
    commands=
        py.test \
            --basetemp={envtmpdir}  \
            --confcutdir=..         \
            -n 3                    \ # use three sub processes
            []

.. _`listed as a known issue`:

Known Issues and limitations
-----------------------------

**Too long filenames**. you may encounter "too long filenames" for temporarily
created files in your py.test run.  Try to not use the "--basetemp" parameter.

**installed-versus-checkout version**.  ``py.test`` collects test
modules on the filesystem and then tries to import them under their
`fully qualified name`_. This means that if your test directory contains
an ``__init__.py`` file then your ``py.test`` invocation may end up
importing the package from the checkout directory rather than the
installed package.  Therefore it is better to try to avoid
``__init__.py`` files in test directories and also try to avoid custom
``PYTHONPATH`` settings.  After all, it is the job of your ``setup.py``
file and the install tools to care for making the package properly
available for importing.
