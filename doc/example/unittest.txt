unittest and tox 
=======================


Running unittests with 'discover'
------------------------------------------

.. _Pygments: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pygments

The discover_ project allows to discover and run unittests 
and we can easily integrate it in a ``tox`` run.  As an example,
perform a checkout of Pygments_::

    hg clone http://dev.pocoo.org/hg/pygments-main

and add the following ``tox.ini`` to it::

    [tox]
    envlist = py25,py26,py27

    [testenv]
    changedir=tests
    commands=discover
    deps=discover

If you now invoke ``tox`` you will see the creation of 
three virtual environments and a unittest-run performed
in each of them.
