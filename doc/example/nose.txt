nose and tox 
=================================

It is easy to integrate `nosetests`_ runs with tox.  
For starters here is a simple ``tox.ini`` config to configure your project 
for running with nose:

Basic nosetests example
--------------------------

Assuming the following layout::

    tox.ini      # see below for content
    setup.py     # a classic distutils/setuptools setup.py file 

and the following ``tox.ini`` content::

    [testenv]
    deps=nose 
    commands=
      nosetests \
            []        # substitute with tox' positional arguments 
    [testenv:py26]
    basepython=python2.6
    [testenv:py25]
    basepython=python2.5

you can invoke ``tox`` in the directory where your ``tox.ini`` resides. 
``tox`` will sdist-package your project create two virtualenv environments 
with the ``python2.6`` and ``python2.5`` interpreters, respectively, and will
then run the specified test command. 


More examples? 
------------------------------------------

You can use and combine other features of ``tox`` with your tox runs, 
e.g. :ref:`sphinx checks`.  If you figure out something related to nose/tox
interactions you are welcome to submit some advanced tips and tricks.
