testing sphinx documentation 
=================================

You can specify any command and thus you can easily
integrate sphinx_ documentation integrity during 
a tox test run.  Here is an example ``tox.ini`` configuration::

    [testenv:docs]
    basepython=python
    changedir=doc
    deps=sphinx
    commands=
        sphinx-build -W -b html -d {envtmpdir}/doctrees .  {envtmpdir}/html

This will create a dedicated environment ``docs`` and install
the ``sphinx`` dependency which itself will install the ``sphinx-build`` tool 
which you can then use as a command.  Note that sphinx output is redirected
to the virtualenv environment temporary directory to prevent sphinx 
from caching results between runs.  

You can now call::

    tox -e docs 

or just::

    tox 

which will make the sphinx tests part of your test run.
