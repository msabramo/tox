General tips and tricks 
================================

Interactively passing positional arguments 
-----------------------------------------------

If you invoke ``tox`` like this::

    tox -- -x tests/test_something.py 

the arguments after the `--` will be substituted 
everywhere where you specify ``[...]`` in your
test commands, for example using ``py.test``::
    
    # in the testenv or testenv:NAME section of your tox.ini 
    commands =
        py.test []

or using ``nosetests``::

    commands = 
        nosetests []

the above ``tox`` invocation will trigger the test runners to 
stop after the first failure and to only run a particular test file. 


Integrating "sphinx" documentation checks
----------------------------------------------

In a ``testenv`` environment you can specify any command and 
thus you can easily integrate sphinx_ documentation integrity during 
a tox test run.  Here is an example ``tox.ini`` configuration::

    [testenv:docs]
    basepython=python
    changedir=doc
    deps=sphinx
    commands=
        sphinx-build -W -b html -d {envtmpdir}/doctrees .  {envtmpdir}/html

This will create a dedicated ``docs`` virtual environment and install
the ``sphinx`` dependency which itself will install the ``sphinx-build`` tool 
which you can then use as a test command.  Note that sphinx output is redirected
to the virtualenv environment temporary directory to prevent sphinx 
from caching results between runs.  

You can now call::

    tox 

which will make the sphinx tests part of your test run. 

Selecting one or more environments to run tests against
--------------------------------------------------------

Using the ``-e ENV[,ENV2,...]``  option you explicitely list 
the environments where you want to run tests against. For
example, given the previous sphinx example you may call::

    tox -e docs

which will make ``tox`` only manage the ``docs`` environment
and call its test commands.  You may specify more than 
one environment like this::

    tox -e py25,py26 

which would run the commands of the ``py25`` and ``py26`` testenvironments 
respectively.
