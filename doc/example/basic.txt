Basic example and default environments
=============================================

Put basic information about your project and the test environments you
want your project to run in into a ``tox.ini`` file that should
reside next to your ``setup.py`` file::

    # content of: tox.ini , put in same dir as setup.py
    [tox]
    envlist = py26,py27
    [testenv]
    commands=py.test  # or 'nosetests' or ...

To sdist-package, install and test your project, you can
now type at the command prompt::

    tox

This will sdist-package your current project, create two virtualenv_
Environments, install the sdist-package into the environments and run
the specified command in each of them.  With::

    tox -e py26

you can run restrict the test run to the python2.6 environment.

Available "default" test environments names are::

    py24
    py25
    py26
    py27
    py30
    py31
    py32
    jython
    pypy

However, you can also create your own test environment names,
see some of the examples in :doc:`examples <../examples>`.
