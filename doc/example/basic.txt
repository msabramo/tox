Basic usage example 
================================

Put basic information about your project and the test environments you
want your project to run in into a ``tox.ini`` file that should 
reside next to your ``setup.py`` file::

    # content of: tox.ini , put in same dir as setup.py 
    [testenv]
    commands=py.test  # or 'nosetests' or ...
    [testenv:py25]
    basepython=python2.5
    [testenv:py26]
    basepython=python2.6

To sdist-package, install and test your project, you can 
now type at the command prompt::

    tox 

This will sdist-package your current project, create virtualenv_
Environments, install the sdist-package into the environments and run
the specified command in each of them.  With::

    tox -e py26 

you can run only tests on Python2.6.
