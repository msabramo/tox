Welcome to the tox automation project 
===============================================

vision: merge testing and deployment 
----------------------------------------

``tox`` aims to automate state-of-the-art packaging, testing and
deployment of Python software right from your console *or* CI
server, invoking your tools of choice.

Current features 
-------------------

* **professional automation of tedious Python related test activities**

* **test your Python package against many interpreter and dependency configs**

    - automatic customizable (re)creation of virtualenv_ test environments 

    - installs your ``setup.py`` based project into each virtual environment

    - test-tool agnostic: runs py.test, nose or unittests a uniform manner

* uses pip_ (for Python2 environments) and distribute_ (for all environments) by default 

* **cross-Python compatible**: Python2.4 up to Python3.1, Jython (and pypy-c, needs patches)

* **cross-platform**: Windows and Unix style environments 

* **integrates with continous integration servers** like Hudson_ and helps
  you to avoid boilerplatish and platform-specific build-step hacks. 

* **unified automatic artifact management** between ``tox`` runs both 
  in a local developer shell as well as in a CI/Hudson context. 

* **driven by a simple ini-style config file**

* **documented** :doc:`examples <examples>` and :doc:`configuration <config>` 

* **concise reporting** about tool invocations and configuration errors


* **professionally** :doc:`supported <support>`

Notes and known limitations 
----------------------------------

* ``tox`` is fresh on the Python testing scene (first release July 2010) and 
  needs some battle testing and feedback. 
  
* ``tox`` is likely to evolve in possibly incompatible increments as it 
  provides more power to configure and customize the test process. 

* ``tox`` uses virtualenv_ and virtualenv3_, the latter being a fork
  which roughly works with Python3 but has less features (no "pip" and
  other problems).  solution: virtualenv_ needs to merge and grow proper 
  native Python3 support, preferably in a "single-source" way. 

* tox does not work on the Windows/Python3/Virtualenv3 combination due
  to limitations of the virtualenv3 fork project. 

* ``tox`` currently uses a ``setup.py sdist`` invocation to create 
  an installable package and then invokes ``pip`` or ``easy_install`` to 
  install into each test environment.  There is no support for other
  installation methods.
