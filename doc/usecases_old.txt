Front-End Runner for Hudson
----------------------------------

- runs on windows and unix, can be invoked from 
  command line and programmatically 

- driven by a tox.ini file 

- sets up python2.4-3.1, jython, pypy-c environments
  with dependencies required for testing 

- runs sdists from the working-copy

- rsync/copies tests to a per-venv home 

- runs py.test on the tests against the installed version

- first goal: run py.test, execnet, tox/venv own tests 

- (can generate a single-script "toxs" version, containing all sources)

Run tests against multiple python versions
--------------------------------------------------

Run my working-copy tests against multiple interpreters::

    tox -i 2.4,2.5,2.6,3.1,jython25,pypy-c

This command would trigger:

1. find or setup 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 3.1,jython25,pypy-c master (venv) environment
2. clone each master environment to a copy (if possible) 
3. package working-copy as 'sdist' package 
4. install sdist in copy-environments 
5. connect to interpreter in the copy
6. run tests remotely in parallel, collect/show reports on the master console 

Run tests in parallel, as quickly as possible 
--------------------------------------------------

Run working-copy tests in multiple environments 

    tox -d 

This command would trigger:

1. find or setup master environments 
2. clone each master environment to a copy (if possible) 
3. package working-copy as 'sdist' package 
4. install sdist in copy-environments 
5. connect to interpreter in the copy
6. run tests remotely in parallel, collect/show reports on the master console 

Run tests in parallel, as quickly as possible 
--------------------------------------------------


This would Driven by a section of the ``tox.ini`` file::

    [interpreter]
    search_executeable = *

    [setup]
    toxworkdir = toxworkdir 
    virtualenv = 

Effectively
