0.7
-----------------

- use virtualenv5 (my own fork of virtualenv3) for now to create python3 
  environments, fixes a couple of issues and makes tox more seemlessly work

- add ``sitepackages`` option for testenv sections so that environments 
  can be created with access to globals (default is not to have access, 
  i.e. create environments with ``--no-site-packages``. 

- addressing issue4: always prepend venv-path to PATH variable when calling subprocesses

- fix issue2: exit with proper non-zero return code if there were 
  errors or test failures. 

- added unittest2 examples contributed by Michael Foord 

- only allow 'True' or 'False' for boolean config values 
  (lowercase / uppercase is irrelevant)

- recreate virtualenv on changed configurations 

0.6
-----------------

- fix OSX related bugs that could cause the caller's environment to get
  screwed (sorry).  tox was using the same file as virtualenv for tracking 
  the Python executable dependency and there also was confusion wrt links. 
  this should be fixed now. 

- fix long description, thanks Michael Foord
